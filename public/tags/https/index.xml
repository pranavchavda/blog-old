      <description>Linode came up with their version of Amazon S3 recently. Object storage is a great way to host a static site. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a server and sites are super easy to deploy. A problem with hosting with object storage though, is that https is not natively supported.
AWS users have the option of using cloudfront. This was an option for me, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use two separate providers for one website.</description>
