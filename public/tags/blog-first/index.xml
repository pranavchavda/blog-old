      <description>First blog post in over a decade! This is my first blog post in 10 years. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I am starting a new blog. I have no content or reason to start one.
I recently used the Hugo static site generator to build a new website. It could have been a simple static html site, but I wanted to try out a hip new technology - took me over a week to begin to understand basic hugo/go syntax, but when the new site was done, one wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description>
