      <description>It has been over a month now since my google, youtube and other social media or news feeds started showing articles by news magazines or papers or blogs about how we were all, as a species, brewing espresso wrongly and that scientists have finally figured out the perfect way to brew a good cup of coffee.
Apparently Brewing Espresso Better involves grinding coarser, with less coffee (15 grams seems to be the accepted amount) and brewing it for half the time one typically would.</description>

      <description>Linode came up with their version of Amazon S3 recently. Object storage is a great way to host a static site. You don&amp;rsquo;t need a server and sites are super easy to deploy. A problem with hosting with object storage though, is that https is not natively supported.
AWS users have the option of using cloudfront. This was an option for me, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use two separate providers for one website.</description>

      <description>First blog post in over a decade! This is my first blog post in 10 years. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why I am starting a new blog. I have no content or reason to start one.
I recently used the Hugo static site generator to build a new website. It could have been a simple static html site, but I wanted to try out a hip new technology - took me over a week to begin to understand basic hugo/go syntax, but when the new site was done, one wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough.</description>
