![the perfect espresso?](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/a5/Tazzina_di_caff%C3%A8_a_Ventimiglia.jpg/330px-Tazzina_di_caff%C3%A8_a_Ventimiglia.jpg)  
It has been over a month now since my google, youtube and other social media or news feeds started showing articles by news magazines or papers or blogs about how we were all, as a species, brewing espresso wrongly and that scientists have finally figured out the perfect way to brew a good cup of coffee.

Apparently [Brewing](https://www.wired.com/story/the-science-behind-crafting-a-perfect-espresso/) [Espresso](https://www.stalberttoday.ca/local-news/science-finds-secret-to-better-espresso-is-less-coffee-christopher-hendon-oregon-2041286) [Better](http://www.digitaljournal.com/tech-and-science/science/math-helps-to-create-a-better-cup-of-espresso/article/566357) involves grinding coarser, with less coffee (15 grams seems to be the accepted amount) and brewing it for half the time one typically would. 

Now I usually brew my espresso for about 35 seconds for a 1:2 coffee in to coffee out ratio ;depending on the coffee, of course, but around that is generally where I will end up. My coffee isn't always perfect. I am not a trained barista and managing the right water temperature on my HX machine is tricky, so a ~~magic~~ science formula where I can brew consistently tasty espresso is tempting, but it is also scary to take the leap and actually see for myself whether or not the 'math' works.
