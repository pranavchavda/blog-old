## First blog post in over a decade!
This is my first blog post in 10 years. I don't know why I am starting a new blog. I have no content or reason to start one.

I recently used the [Hugo](https;//gohugo.io) static site generator to build a new website. It could have been a simple static html site, but I wanted to try out a hip new technology - took me over a week to begin to understand basic hugo/go syntax, but when the new site was done, one wasn't enough.

My very first blog was in WordPress - back when it wasn't version 1.0 yet. So blogs in my mind have always been something that require a database and a dynamic scripting language such as PHP to run. In spite the fact that at one point in time I used to have a geocities site, the idea of a blog as just static html files seemed too novel to pass. Hence, this blog. More info about me and what you, the reader, and me, the blogger, can expect here in the future coming up in the about page (at some point).
